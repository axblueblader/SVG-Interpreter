# Svg Interpreter
Source code for an application that interprets a predefined SVG file (with the help of rapidxml library), store the data as objects using OOP, Factory Pattern, Composite Pattern and draw the result on screen using GDI+ library. This was a project from my CS course in OOP and Design Patterns.
